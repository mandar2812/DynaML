/**
  * Defines the basic skeleton of a "meta-model" or
  * a model of models.
  *
  * A set of base models are trained on sub-sampled versions
  * of the training data set and finally a predictor of the form.
  *
  * y(x) = f(y1(x), y2(x), ..., yb(x))
  *
  * Where f is some combination function and
  * b is the number of base models used.
  *
  * @tparam D The type of the data structure containing the
  *           training data set.
  * @tparam D1 The type of data structure containing the data
  *            of the base models.
  * @tparam BaseModel The type of model used as base model
  *                   for the meta model.
  *                   example: [[FeedForwardNetwork]], [[GPRegression]], etc
  * @tparam Pipe A sub-type of [[ModelPipe]] which yields a [[BaseModel]]
  *              with [[D1]] as the base data structure given a
  *              data structure of type [[D]]
  * @param num The number of training data points.
  * @param data The actual training data
  * @param networks A sequence of [[Pipe]] objects yielding [[BaseModel]]

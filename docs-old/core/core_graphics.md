!!! summary
    The [`dynaml.graphics`](https://transcendent-ai-labs.github.io/api_docs/DynaML/recent/dynaml-core/#io.github.mandar2812.dynaml.graphics.package) 
    package is a new addition to the API since the v1.5.3 release. It aims to provide more unified access point to producing
    visualizations.
    
    
## 3D Plots

Support for 3d visualisations is provided by the `dynaml.graphics.plot3d`, under the hood the `plot3d` object calls 
the Jzy3d library to produce interactive 3d plots.

Producing 3d charts involves similar procedure for each chart kind, use `plot3d.draw()` to generate a chart object,
and use `plot3d.show()` to display it in a GUI.


### Surface Plots

The most common usage of `plot3d` is to visualise 3 dimensional surfaces, this can be done in two ways.

#### From defined functions

If the user can express the surface as a function of two arguments.

```scala
import io.github.tailhq.dynaml.graphics._

val mexican_hat = 
  (x: Double, y: Double) => 
    (1.0/math.Pi)*(1.0 - 0.5*(x*x + y*y))*math.exp(-0.5*(x*x + y*y))
    

val mexican_hat_chart = plot3d.draw(mexican_hat)

plot3d.show(mexican_hat_chart)
```

#### From a set of points 

If the surface is not determined completely, but only sampled over a discrete set of points, 
it is still possible to visualise an approximation to the surface, using _Delauney triangulation_.

```scala
import io.github.tailhq.dynaml.graphics._
import io.github.tailhq.dynaml.probability._

//A function generating the surface need not be known,
//as long as one has access to the sampled points.
val func = (x: Double, y: Double) => 
  math.sin(x*y + y*x) - math.cos(y*y*x - x*x*y) 
//Sample the 2d plane using a gaussian distribution
val rv2d = GaussianRV(0.0, 2.0) :* GaussianRV(0.0, 2.0)
//Generate some random points and their z values
val points = rv2d.iid(1000).draw.map(c => (c, func(c._1, c._2)))

val plot = plot3d.draw(points)
plot3d.show(plot)
```

### Histograms

The `plot3d` object also allows the user to visualise 3d histograms from collections of
points on the 2d plane, expressed as a collection of `(Double, Double)`.

```scala
import io.github.tailhq.dynaml.graphics._
import io.github.tailhq.dynaml.probability._
import io.github.tailhq.dynaml.probability.distributions._

//Create two different random variables to 
//sample x and y coordinates.
val rv_x = RandomVariable(new SkewGaussian(2.0, 0.0, 1.0)) 
val rv_y = RandomVariable(new SkewGaussian(-4.0, 0.0, 0.5)) 
//Sample a point on the 2d plane 
val rv  = rv_x :* rv_y 

val histogram = plot3d.draw(rv.iid(2000).draw, 40) 
plot3d.show(histogram)
```

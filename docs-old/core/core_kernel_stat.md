Stationary kernels can be expressed as a function of the difference between their inputs.

$$
	C(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}) = K(||\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{y}||_{p})
$$

Note that any norm may be used to quantify the distance between the two vectors $\mathbf{x} \ \& \ \mathbf{y}$. The values $p = 1$ and $p = 2$ represent the _Manhattan distance_ and _Euclidean distance_ respectively.

!!! note "Instantiating Stationary Kernels"
		Stationary kernels are implemented as a subset of the [```StationaryKernel[T, V, M]```](https://transcendent-ai-labs.github.io/api_docs/DynaML/recent/dynaml-core/index.html#io.github.mandar2812.dynaml.kernels.StationaryKernel) class which requires a ```Field[T]``` implicit object (an algebraic field which has definitions for addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of its elements much like the number system). You may also import ```spire.implicits._``` in order to load the default field implementations for basic data types like ```Int```, ```Double``` and so on. Before instantiating any child class of ```StationaryKernel``` one needs to enter the following code.

		```scala
			import spire.algebra.Field
			import io.github.tailhq.dynaml.analysis.VectorField
			//Calculate the number of input features
			//and create a vector field of that dimension
			val num_features: Int = ...
			implicit val f = VectorField(num_features)
		```

## Radial Basis Function Kernel

![kernel](../../images/gaussiankernel.jpg)

$$
C(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}) = exp\left(-\frac{||\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}||^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)
$$

The RBF kernel is the most popular kernel function applied in machine learning, it represents an inner product space which is spanned by the _Hermite_ polynomials and as such is suitable to model smooth functions. The RBF kernel is also called a _universal_ kernel for the reason that any smooth function can be represented with a high degree of accuracy assuming we can find a suitable value of the bandwidth.

```scala
val rbf = new RBFKernel(4.0)
```

### Squared Exponential Kernel

A generalization of the RBF Kernel is the Squared Exponential Kernel

$$
	C(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}) = h \ exp\left(-\frac{||\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}||^2}{2l^2}\right)
$$

```scala
val rbf = new SEKernel(4.0, 2.0)
```

### Mahalanobis Kernel

This kernel is a further generalization of the SE kernel. It uses the [Mahalanobis distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahalanobis_distance) instead of the Euclidean distance between the inputs.

$$
	C(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}) = h \ exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y})^\intercal \Sigma^{-1} (\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y})\right)
$$

The Mahalanobis distance $(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y})^\intercal \Sigma^{-1} (\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y})$ is characterized by a symmetric positive definite matrix $\Sigma$. This distance metric reduces to the Euclidean distance if $\Sigma$ is the _identity matrix_. Further, if $\Sigma$ is diagonal, the _Mahalanobis kernel_ becomes the _Automatic Relevance Determination_ version of the SE kernel (SE-ARD).

In DynaML the class `#!scala MahalanobisKernel` implements the SE-ARD kernel with diagonal $\Sigma$.

```scala
val bandwidths: DenseVector[Double] = _
val amp = 1.5

val maha_kernel = new MahalanobisKernel(bandwidths, amp)
```

## Student T Kernel

$$
	C(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}) = \frac{1}{1 + ||\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}||^d}
$$

```scala
val tstud = new TStudentKernel(2.0)
```


## Rational Quadratic Kernel

$$
	C(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}) = \left( 1 + \frac{||\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}||^2}{2 \mu \ell^2} \right)^{-\frac{1}{2}  (dim(\mathbf{x})+\mu)}
$$

```scala
val rat = new RationalQuadraticKernel(shape = 1.5, l = 1.5)
```

## Cauchy Kernel

$$
	C(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}) = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{||\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}||^2}{\sigma^2}}
$$

```scala
val cau = new CauchyKernel(2.5)
```

## Gaussian Spectral Kernel

$$
C(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}) = cos(2\pi \mu ||\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}||) \ exp(-2\pi^{2} \sigma^{2} ||\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}||^{2} )
$$

```scala
//Define how the hyper-parameter Map gets transformed to the kernel parameters
val encoder = Encoder(
  (conf: Map[String, Double]) => (conf("c"), conf("s")),
  (cs: (Double, Double)) => Map("c" -> cs._1, "s" -> cs._2))

val gsmKernel = GaussianSpectralKernel[Double](3.5, 2.0, encoder)
```

## Matern Half Integer

The Matern kernel is an important family of covariance functions. Matern covariances are parameterized via two quantities i.e. order $\nu$ and $\rho$ the characteristic length scale. The general matern covariance is defined in terms of modified _Bessel_ functions.

$$
C_{\nu}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}) = \frac{2^{1-\nu}}{\Gamma(\nu)} \left(\sqrt{2\nu}\frac{d}{\rho}\right)^{\nu} K_{\nu}\left(\sqrt{2\nu}\frac{d}{\rho}\right)
$$

Where $d = ||\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{y}||$ is the Euclidean ($L_2$) distance between points.

For the case $\nu = p + \frac{1}{2}, p \in \mathbb{N}$ the expression becomes.

$$
C_{\nu}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}) =  exp\left(-\sqrt{2\nu}\frac{d}{\rho}\right) \frac{\Gamma(p+1)}{\Gamma(2p+1)} \sum_{i = 0}^{p}{\frac{(p+1)!}{i!(p-i)!}\left(\sqrt{8\nu}\frac{d}{\rho}\right)^{p-i}}
$$

Currently there is only support for matern half integer kernels.

```scala
implicit ev = VectorField(2)
val matKern = new GenericMaternKernel(1.5, p = 1)
```

## Wavelet Kernel

The Wavelet kernel ([Zhang et al, 2004](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2003.811113)) comes from Wavelet theory and is given as

$$
	C(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}) = \prod_{i = 1}^{d} h\left(\frac{x_i-y_i}{a}\right)
$$

Where the function `h` is known as the mother wavelet function, Zhang et. al suggest the following expression for the mother wavelet function.

$$
	h(x) = cos(1.75x)exp(-\frac{1}{2}x^2)
$$

```scala
val wv = new WaveletKernel(x => math.cos(1.75*x)*math.exp(-1.0*x*x/2.0))(1.5)
```

## Periodic Kernel

The periodic kernel has _Fourier_ series as its orthogonal eigenfunctions. It is used when constructing predictive models over quantities which are known to have some periodic behavior.

$$
C(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}) = exp\left(-2 \ sin^{2}\left(\frac{\pi \omega ||\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}||}{l^2}\right)\right)
$$

```scala
val periodic_kernel = new PeriodicKernel(lengthscale = 1.5, freq = 2.5)
```

## Wave Kernel

$$
C(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}) = \frac{\theta}{||\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{y}||^2} \times sin(\frac{||\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{y}||^2}{\theta})
$$

```scala
val wv_kernel = WaveKernel(th = 1.0)
```

## Laplacian Kernel

The Laplacian kernel is the covariance function of the well known [Ornstein Ulhenbeck process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornstein%E2%80%93Uhlenbeck_process), samples drawn from this process are continuous and only once differentiable.


$$
\begin{equation}
C(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}) = exp \left(-\frac{||\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}||_{1}}{2\beta}\right)
\end{equation}
$$


```scala
val lap = new LaplacianKernel(4.0)
```
